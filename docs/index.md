# Compressive Framework â€” Dynamic Particle Formation (CF-DPF)

A computational, visual, and mathematical exploration of how compressed wavefields produce localized, particle-like structures.  
The project models interactions between four core fields:

- **Ïˆ(t,x)** â€” wave/information amplitude  
- **Î¦(t,x)** â€” *graviton* (spatial compressive potential)  
- **Ï‡(t,x)** â€” *chronon* (temporal coherence / time-binding)  
- **C(t,x)** â€” *cognon* (informational/occupancy field)

## Quick start

Use the notebooks below to follow the full narrative: waves compress â†’ coherence forms â†’ particles emerge â†’ particles move, bind, and build structure.

| # | Notebook | Description |
|:-:|:--|:--|
| 1 | [**Wave Compression**](notebooks/01_wave_compression.md) | The foundation of CF â€” describing how standing waves compress into quantized pockets of energy density. |
| 2 | [**Chronon Dynamics**](notebooks/02_chronon_dynamics.md) | Examines time quantization and oscillatory frequency coupling in compressed wave regions. |
| 3 | [**Particle Formation**](notebooks/03_particle_formation.md) | Demonstrates how sustained wave interference creates localized particle presence. |
| 4 | [**Wave â†’ Particle Motion**](notebooks/04_wave_to_particle_motion.md) | Describes how wave resonance transitions into directed particle movement. |
| 5 | [**Fractional Presence & Nonlocal Binding**](notebooks/05_fractional_presence.md) | Explores how particle fields exist fractionally across nonlocal regions through compression entanglement. |
| 6 | [**Multi-Particle Coalescence**](notebooks/06_particle_coalescence.md) | Shows how multiple wave-particles merge or repel based on phase and compression symmetry. |
| 7 | [**Field Interactions**](notebooks/07_field_interactions.md) | Examines emergent forces and self-organizing field geometries from particle networks. |

## About this site

- The notebooks are written to be readable inside MkDocs (Markdown) and optionally executable when `mkdocs-jupyter` or `nbconvert` is used.  
- Visuals are saved to `docs/assets/images/` and referenced from notebooks; if a figure is missing on a page, make sure `docs/assets/images/*` has been committed.
