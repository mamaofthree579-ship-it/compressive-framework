# Compressive Framework — Dynamic Particle Formation (CF-DPF)

A computational, visual, and mathematical exploration of how compressed wavefields produce localized, particle-like structures.  
The project models interactions between four core fields:

- **ψ(t,x)** — wave/information amplitude  
- **Φ(t,x)** — *graviton* (spatial compressive potential)  
- **χ(t,x)** — *chronon* (temporal coherence / time-binding)  
- **C(t,x)** — *cognon* (informational/occupancy field)

## Quick start

Use the notebooks below to follow the full narrative: waves compress → coherence forms → particles emerge → particles move, bind, and build structure.

## Recommended reading order

1. Start at **01 — Wave Compression** to learn the compressive wave model.  
2. Continue with **02 — Chronon Dynamics** then **03 — Graviton** and **04 — Cognon** to understand the three supporting fields.  
3. Read **05** and **06** for particle nucleation and motion.  
4. Use **07 → 09** to study coalescence, entanglement, and binding.  
5. Finish with **10** to see how discrete curvature emerges.

## About this site

- The notebooks are written to be readable inside MkDocs (Markdown) and optionally executable when `mkdocs-jupyter` or `nbconvert` is used.  
- Visuals are saved to `docs/assets/images/` and referenced from notebooks; if a figure is missing on a page, make sure `docs/assets/images/*` has been committed.
