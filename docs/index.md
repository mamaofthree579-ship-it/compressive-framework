# Compressive Framework (CF)

A unified dynamic model for particle formation and gravitational compression.

The **Compressive Framework** proposes that all particles and curvature arise from **localized wave compression** and **nonlinear field coupling**.

## Core Idea

- ψ(t, x): wavefunction of information field  
- χ(t, x): chronon (time-binding field)  
- Φ(t, x): compressive potential  
- λ_c: coupling strength (controls collapse → formation)
