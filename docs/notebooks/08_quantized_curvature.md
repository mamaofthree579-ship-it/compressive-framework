# Notebook 08 — Quantized Curvature

## Overview

This notebook explores how **curvature emerges in quantized space**, linking particle formation and tri-field interactions to *spacetime geometry*.  
Within the Compressive Framework, **curvature is not continuous** — it arises from discrete compression nodes generated by graviton-wave resonance.

## 1. Curvature as Compression Density

We define quantized curvature \( \mathcal{K} \) as a function of compression energy density \( \rho_c \):

\[
\mathcal{K}(x,t) = \alpha \, \sin(\rho_c(x,t))
\]

where \( \alpha \) is the curvature sensitivity constant.

2. Local Curvature Nodes

Curvature quantization manifests through discrete compression wells where space momentarily stabilizes before re-expanding.

3. Graviton Influence on Curvature

The graviton field γ(x,t) modifies curvature intensity through its frequency and amplitude coupling.
We approximate this interaction using a scaling function:

[
\mathcal{K}_{\text{γ-mod}} = \mathcal{K}(x,t) \cdot (1 + \beta \sin(\omega_γ t))
]

4. Curvature Discretization Spectrum

Curvature quantization forms energy bands, analogous to discrete harmonic states.

5. Phase-Space Geometry

The curvature also defines phase-space geometry, where compression and expansion oscillate around stable attractors.

6. Temporal Stability Curve

The temporal stability of curvature describes how oscillations sustain spacetime continuity.
When damping equals curvature feedback, the system self-regulates.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

t = np.linspace(0, 20, 400)
stability = np.exp(-0.05*t) * np.sin(2*t)
feedback = np.cos(2*t) * 0.5

plt.figure(figsize=(7,3))
plt.plot(t, stability, label="Curvature Stability Oscillation")
plt.plot(t, feedback, label="Feedback Regulation", linestyle='--')
plt.title("Temporal Stability Curve of Curvature Feedback")
plt.xlabel("Time (t)")
plt.ylabel("Amplitude")
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

7. Quantized Curvature Summary

Property | Symbol | Description
----------------------------

Curvature Density -> ( \rho_c ) -> Compression-based energy density

Curvature Field -> ( \mathcal{K} ) -> Local curvature amplitude

Graviton Influence -> ( \mathcal{K}_γ ) -> Frequency modulation due to γ

Stability Function -> ( S(t) ) -> Time-dependent self-regulation

8. Conceptual Recap

Curvature arises not as a continuous bend of space, but as a compressed oscillation lattice — a self-maintaining wave network connecting the gravitational and temporal fields.

“Space curves because compression ripples are quantized,
and reality bends where information meets gravity.”
