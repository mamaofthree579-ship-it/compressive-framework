# Contributing to the Compressive Framework (CF‚ÄìDPF)

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **CF‚ÄìDPF (Compressive Framework ‚Äî Dynamic Particle Formation)**!  
This project explores theoretical physics and simulation concepts through interactive notebooks and visual models.

## üß≠ Contribution Guidelines

### 1. Setting up your environment
Before contributing, ensure you have the dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

Then serve the documentation locally:

mkdocs serve

2. Branching & Workflow
	‚Ä¢	main ‚Üí stable release branch (only reviewed merges)
	‚Ä¢	dev ‚Üí active development branch (PRs go here)
	‚Ä¢	feature/ ‚Üí for new modules or notebooks
	‚Ä¢	fix/ ‚Üí for bug patches or small corrections

Example: git checkout -b feature/notebook11_new_effect

git checkout -b feature/notebook11_new_effect

```python
# code
```

4. Submitting Pull Requests
	1.	Fork the repository
	2.	Create your feature branch
	3.	Commit changes with clear messages
	4.	Submit a pull request to the dev branch

### ‚öôÔ∏è **`api.md`**
*(Documenting available modules and potential interfaces)*

```markdown
# CF‚ÄìDPF API Reference

This document outlines the **programmatic interface** and structure of the Compressive Framework.  
It is intended for developers integrating CF‚ÄìDPF modules into research tools or simulations.

## üß© Core Modules

| Module | Description |
|:-------|:-------------|
| `cf.wave` | Handles wave compression, resonance, and harmonic transformations. |
| `cf.chronon` | Models chronon (quantum time) dynamics. |
| `cf.particle` | Manages particle formation, coalescence, and interactions. |
| `cf.fields` | Describes interaction fields (graviton, cognon, etc.) and nonlocal binding. |
| `cf.vacuum` | Models vacuum symmetry breaking and domain formation. |
| `cf.visuals` | Utility for plots, animations, and visual diagnostics. |

---

## üß† Example Usage

```python
from cf.wave import WaveCompressor
from cf.particle import ParticleSimulator

wave = WaveCompressor(frequency=4.2, amplitude=1.0)
particles = ParticleSimulator(wave)
particles.simulate(steps=1000)
particles.plot()
```

üßÆ Math and Physics Utilities

These are helper functions used across multiple notebooks: from cf.utils import hbar, c, planck_length

E = hbar * 2 * np.pi * frequency
print(f"Energy: {E:.3e} J")


‚∏ª

üöÄ Future API Goals
	‚Ä¢	Introduce unified simulation class: CFUniverse()
	‚Ä¢	Add parallelized backends for larger-scale particle simulations
	‚Ä¢	Build API wrappers for visualization dashboards
