# 🌌 CF-DPF Interactive Simulator

Welcome to the **Compressive Framework — Dynamic Particle Formation Simulator**.

This tool allows you to explore how **Graviton (γ)**, **Chronon (χ)**, and **Cognon (κ)** fields interact to form curvature and quantum domains.

## 🧩 Launch Simulator

[🚀 **Open CF-DPF Simulator**](https://[(http://localhost:8501))] {: .md-button .md-button--primary }

> The simulator runs a live Python backend powered by **Streamlit**.  
> Adjust α, β, and γ to explore wave coupling and resonance across space-time.

### 🧠 About the Simulator

The simulator dynamically models:
- Wave-field superposition Ψ(x,t)
- Curvature gradients 𝒦(x,t)
- Resonance and symmetry breaking
- Particle-domain emergence (in later modules)
